#Fix my Title, Version 1.0
_2014 Ty-Lucas Kelley_

###What is it?

A clean and simple Chrome extension that lets you type or paste in a title, and then fixes any capitalization errors! Simply start typing and your mistakes will be  corrected on the go.

###How does it work?

You type, and a simple Javascript function (credit to [David Gouch](http://individed.com/code/to-title-case/)) automatically changes your input when a mistake is found.

###Where can I get it?

Right here, at the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fix-my-title/cbaagoaigiobmonebiebljfnkekfpkif).
